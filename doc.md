Shared Trip is an application where the users could post an announcement about a Trip. 
And also get information for other trips and share the travel expenses.
It uses Asp.Net Core for the server-side and SQL Server for data storage. 
Its UI uses Angular.
The application has a few pages. The main one is a Grid where are listed all of the available Trips and a button for navigation, 
to the details page of the Trip. The user who created a Trip on the details page could access two buttons to either delete or edit a Trip.
The user has a profile, where he can see more information about himself and edit his picture, email, etc. 
There is a Chat page, that is public and everyone could write in the chat if he is going to travel soon. 
There is also a news page that uses a scraper on the server and gets news from АПИ.
